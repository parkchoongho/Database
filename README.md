## Basic SQL

### What is a Database?

A **Database** is a collection of data stored in a format that can be easily accessed. In order to manage the databases, we use a software application called **database management system(DBMS)**. We connect to a DBMS, give it a instructions for querying or modifying data. The DBMS will execute our instructions and send results back.

There are many **DBMS**s and these are classified into two categories, **relational and non relational**, also called **NoSQL**. In **relational databases**, we store data in tables that are linked to each other using **relationships**. That's why we call these databases relational databases. **SQL** is the language that we use to work with these **relational database management systems**.

(NoSQL DBMS don't understand SQL)
